AutoHokey scripts for starcraft on numpad

This is an autohotkey script to use starcraft 1 (and possibly 2) that is built to work with a bluetooth numpad (YXFLY). It implements some QOL functionality like quick save/load and aims to keep a user's hand in a comfortable position when issuing basic commands rather than having to move your hands around the keyboard searching for keybinds.
